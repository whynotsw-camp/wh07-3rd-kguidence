Later, in August of the 7th year of King Sejong\'s reign (1425), the palace was renamed Yeonhui Palace.

Among them, the preserved well is called the Site of Concubine Jang Huibin??s Well.During the reign of King Sukjong (1674-1720), Huibin Jang (1659-1701), who followed Queen Inhyeon, who was deposed, briefly stayed at this place as a concubine, but there is no proof she drank from the well.

The Imjin War (the Japanese invasions in 1592) left all the palaces in Korea severely damaged. When King Seonjo (the fourteenth king of the Joseon Dynasty) returned to Seoul from his evacuation, the primary palace Gyeongbokgung Palace had been burnt to the ground and other palaces were also heavily damaged. A temporary palace was chosen from among the houses of the royal family. This is the origin of Deoksugung Palace. King Gwanghaegun (the fifteenth king of the Joseon Dynasty) named the palace Gyeongungung, formalizing it as a royal palace. Since then it has been used as an auxiliary palace by many Joseon kings. In 1897, Emperor Gojong (the twenty-sixth king of the Joseon Dynasty) stayed here and expanded it. The modern buildings such as Seokjojeon (Hall) were constructed during this period. In 1907, the palace was renamed Deoksugung.','-10642','Daily 9:00 - 21:00 (Last entry 20:00)','Closed Mondays','100-120  99 Sejong-daero, Jung-gu, Seoul','Subway Line 1/2 City Hall Station  Exit 1,  72m','https://english.visitseoul.net/comm/getImage?srvcId=MEDIA&parentSn=67606&fileTy=MEDIA&fileNo=3&thumbTy=L | https://english.visitseoul.net/comm/getImage?srvcId=MEDIA&parentSn=67607&fileTy=MEDIA&fileNo=3&thumbTy=L | https://english.visitseoul.net/comm/getImage?srvcId=MEDIA&parentSn=67608&fileTy=MEDIA&fileNo=2&thumbTy=L | https://english.visitseoul.net/comm/getImage?srvcId=MEDIA&parentSn=67609&fileTy=MEDIA&fileNo=2&thumbTy=L | https://english.visitseoul.net/comm/getImage?srvcId=MEDIA&parentSn=67610&fileTy=MEDI',5.000000,37.565936,'ENP002046'),

It\'s located east of the primary palace of Gyeongbokgung, so it is also referred to as \"Donggwol,\" the \"East Palace.\"Myeongjeongjeon is the main hall of the palace, where state affairs were held, such as meetings with officials and the reception of foreign envoys. In particular, Myeongjeongjeon represents an outstanding example of seventeenth century Joseon architectural style and is the oldest main hall of any palace. While visiting Changgyeonggung Palace, it is recommended you visit nearby Changdeokgung Palace as well.Most of the palace buildings were destroyed by the Japanese during the Japanese invasion of Korea in 1592. The main buildings such as Myeongjeongjeon, Munjeongjeon (council hall), Hwangyeongjeon (Hall), Inyangjeon (Hall), Gongsacheong, and Honghwamun (Gate) were rebuilt by King Gwanghaegun (the fifteenth king of the Joseon Dynasty). During the Japanese occupation, the Japanese built a zoo on the site and renamed the palace \"Changgyeongwon,\" meaning \"Changgyeong Garden.\" Since 1987, the palace has been reconstructed and now resembles its original form. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"LocalBusiness\", \"name\": \"Changgyeonggung Palace\", \"aggregateRating\": { \"@type\": \"AggregateRating\", \"ratingValue\": \"4.5\", \"ratingCount\": \"765\" }, \"review\": [{ \"@type\": \"Review\", \"reviewRating\": { \"@type\": \"Rating\", \"ratingValue\": \"5\" }, \"author\": { \"@type\": \"Person\", \"name\": \"MyNeoAj\" }, \"reviewBody\": \"I would recommend you to renting a hanbok before come here,It\'s a good experience you should do.
